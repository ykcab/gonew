# gonew
A small hacky script to create a new Go project inspired by [Hugo new command](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-4-add-some-content)

### Requirements
You must have `GOPATH` already configured.  

The script creates a new project directory to your $GOPATH/src folder.

### Example

`$ gonew test`  
`$ ls $GOPATH/src/test`  
`$ test.go`
